HyperGraphNeuralNetworks.jl is a (hyper)graph neural network library written in Julia meant to be used with the machine learning library [Lux.jl](https://lux.csail.mit.edu/stable/). It is strongly inspired by [GraphNeuralNetworks.jl](https://juliagraphs.org/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/docs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/stable/) and builds off of [SimpleHypergraphs.jl](https://github.com/pszufe/SimpleHypergraphs.jl) and [SimpleDirectedHypergraphs.jl](https://github.com/CoReACTER/SimpleDirectedHypergraphs.jl).
